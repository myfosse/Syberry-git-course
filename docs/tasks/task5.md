#### Split, rebased

You've implemented two features and made one commit. According to the guidelines you have to make one commit per feature, so your TL after the review asked you to split the commit in two.

Your task is to:
- split one commit (`git-course_5_feature` branch) in two:
  - `306: Add prod to allowed origins` - changes in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
  - `304: Add more hotels with migration` - other changes
- rebase onto dev branch (`git-course_5_dev`)
- make screenshots confirming each step and screenshots of the result
- add screenshots to `screenshots` folder
