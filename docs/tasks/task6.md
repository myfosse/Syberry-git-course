#### Recover lost commits after removing a branch

Imagine you implemented a feature (`git-course_6_feature` branch), didn't push it and accidentally deleted the local branch with two commits.

You need:
- delete `git-course_6_feature` branch locally and from origin (yes, do it!)
- restore lost commits with Git
- attach screenshots of the results of the commands that you used to restore the branch (or command line listing)
