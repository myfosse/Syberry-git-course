#### Recover lost commits after removing a branch

You've implemented a feature (`git-course_6_feature` branch), but didn't push it, and accidentally deleted the local branch with two commits.

Your task is to:
- don't panic
- delete `git-course_6_feature` branch locally and from origin (yes, do it!)
- restore lost commits with Git
- make screenshots confirming each step and screenshots of the results of the commands that you used to restore the branch (or command line listing)
- add screenshots to `screenshots` folder
