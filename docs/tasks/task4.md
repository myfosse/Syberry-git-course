#### Delete a commit

You've implemented two features (`git-course_4_feature` branch). <br>
At the latest meeting the team decided that the first feature is not needed and is not going to be delivered.

Your task is to:
- rebase the second commit (`202: Disable cors`) only onto `dev` branch (`git-course_4_dev`)
- resolve conflicts (all your changes are more important)
- make screenshots confirming each step and screenshots of the result
- add screenshots to `screenshots` folder
