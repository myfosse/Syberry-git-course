#### Delete a commit

Imagine you implemented two features (`git-course_4_feature` branch).
At the meeting the team decided that the first feature is not needed now.

You need:
- only rebase the second commit (`202: Disable cors`) onto `dev` branch (`git-course_4_dev`)
- resolve conflicts (all your changes are more important)
