#### Cherry pick

Imagine you fixed defects (`git-course_7_defects` branch).
At the meeting the team decided that some of them are not needed now.

You need:
- transfer all commits from `git-course_7_defects` branch to `git-course_7_2_defects` except:
  - `Add prod to allowed origins`
  - `139532: Add more hotels with migration`
  - `139532: Add more hotels with migration`
