#### Split, rebased

You've fixed a defect (`git-course_2_defects` branch). <br>
Your TL later said, that in fact, these are two different defects.

Your task is to:
- split one commit (`git-course_2_defects` branch) into two:
    * `1023: Fix cors` - added file `src/main/java/hotels/security/SecurityConfig.java`
    * `1038: Fix deployment` - other changes
- rebase onto `dev` branch (`git-course_2_dev`)
- resolve conflicts (all your changes are more important)
- make screenshots confirming each step and screenshots of the result
- add screenshots to `screenshots` folder
