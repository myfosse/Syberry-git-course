# Git course project

Welcome to the Git course!

Before you start you need to:
- Familiarize with:
  - Documentation

    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 - Must read

    https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell - Very important chapter

    https://gitimmersion.com

    https://githowto.com

  - GUI Clients

    https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

  - Commit style guide

    https://git.syberry.com/syberry-policies/production-process/-/blob/master/engineering/version-control/commit-style-guide.md

- Fork this project to your namespace
- Add the reviewer to your project with `Developer` permission (ask the manager about the reviewer)


### Definition of done

- Commits comply with [style guide](https://git.syberry.com/syberry-policies/production-process/-/blob/master/engineering/version-control/commit-style-guide.md)
- All completed tasks pushed to your own project
- Your branch is rebased onto `dev` branch (each task has its own `dev` branch like `git-course_[N]_dev`)
- Git merge request is created (in each task to its own `dev` branch)
- You MUST NOT do anything with `dev` branches
