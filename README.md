- Add the reviewer to your project as a `Developer` (ask your manager about the reviewer)
- Create a `screenshots` folder `https://git.syberry.com/j.doe/git-course/screenshots`

### Definition of Done
What does it mean for a task to be complete:
1. All commits comply with the [Syberry Style Guide](https://git.syberry.com/syberry-policies/production-process/-/blob/master/engineering/version-control/commit-style-guide.md)
2. All completed tasks pushed to your own project
3. Your branch is rebased onto `dev` branch (each task has its own `dev` branch like `git-course_[N]_dev`)
4. Git merge request is created in each task to its own `dev` branch
5. Screenshots confirming each step are uploaded to the `screenshots` folder

Please note: you `MUST NOT` do anything with `dev` branches
